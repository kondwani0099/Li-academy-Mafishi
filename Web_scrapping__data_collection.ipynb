            "Mechanical engineering concerns the design, construction and use of mechanical devices. This covers a broad range of machines such as internal combustion engines, industrial equipment and manufacturing plants. The program offers students the opportunity to learn real-world engineering principles, analyse and interpret machine performance and detailed analysis of machines.\n",
            "Students studying Mechanical engineering cover a wide range of topics including mechanics, thermodynamics, fluid mechanics and materials. Students will carry out individual project work, which allows them to apply the knowledge they have gained during their studies to a problem in Mechanical engineering as well as visit industrial sites,\n",
            "The Mechanical engineer developed by this program is a skilled, practical engineer with the knowledge of machine design who will have opportunity to work in a mining sector, manufacturing plants, cements plants etc. both locally and abroad.\n",
            "Rationale\n",
            "A degree programme in Mechanical Engineering provide support and expertise to those areas in schools such as mines and mineral sciences, business, natural resources and the built environment which all have components of mechanical engineering in their curricular. Job opportunities for graduating students are plentiful, encompassing both the private and public sectors. The degree is popular to school leavers and current employees in both the private and public sectors who may wish to upgrade their qualifications.\n",
